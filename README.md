# Homework 2 - Scripting & Newton's Method

This repo contains a Newton's Method solver and a Perl script for running the solver. In order to run the solver, clone this repository and execute 

```bash
$ perl NewtonS.p
```

Several functions have been tested with the solver, and the results have been documented in `Report.tex`.
